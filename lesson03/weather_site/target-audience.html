      <p>
        Mike is a Ham Radio Enthusiast who holds an Amature Extra Class license granting him full access to all of the frequencies available to Ham Radio Operators. He would like to make some contacts over in Europe, but needs the right weather conditions.

      </p>
      <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
      <p>
        The skys are nice and clear, allowing for nice signal propagation in the atmosphere. Because it's during the daytime, there should be no issue for Mike making a contact (or two) in Europe
      </p>
      <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
      <p>
        The skys are a little overcast. Shelby is using her hand held radio. She's able to talk to someone on the other side of the mountains because she's able to bounce her signal off of the light clouds.
      </p>
      <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
      <p>
         A Ham Radio operator wants to talk to the Astronauts on the International Space Station. They are looking for a weather forcast to see if there is anything that will cause interference. 
      </p>
      <h3>Scenario 4</h3>
      <p>
        A local organization is planning on using Ham Radio Operators to help with comunications for their Charity 5k run. They are interested in the weather, so they can approact the local Ham Radio Club to see if there will be any issues. 
      </p>
      <h3>Scenario 5</h3>
      <p>
        A Ham Radio Operator is trying to make contact with a friend in the next state over, but is unable to connect with them. It's currently winter, and there may be weather conditions interfering with signals (like Fog)
